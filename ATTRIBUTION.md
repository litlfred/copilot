# Attribution

We would like to acknowledge and thank:

- The developers and maintainers of all referenced open-source libraries and tools used in this project.
- The broader open-source community for their dedication, innovation, and spirit of collaboration.
- The software developers whose code and intellectual output contributed, directly or indirectly, to the training and effectiveness of AI systems like GitHub Copilot.

## About Open Source Contributions and AI Training

GitHub Copilot, the AI system assisting in this project, was trained on vast amounts of publicly available code, much of it from open-source repositories. The collective creativity, knowledge, and best practices from these open-source projects form the foundation of Copilotâ€™s ability to suggest code, generate documentation, and assist developers.

Open source codebases provide not only examples of how to solve complex programming problems, but also embody the collaborative ethos that drives innovation. By leveraging the wisdom and diversity of the global open source community, Copilot is able to suggest solutions that reflect real-world practices and standards.

We express our deep gratitude to every open source contributor whose work, whether large or small, has helped make these AI-assisted tools possible. This project stands on your shoulders.

Your efforts make projects like this possible, and we are grateful for your contributions.

## On Logging AI-Assisted Development

If any code was developed with the assistance of an AI model (such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT), contributors are required to log and provide a record of the relevant conversation. This log should be referenced in the commit message (see [Code Style Policy](CODE_STYLE.md#use-of-git)), and included in the repository as appropriate. This requirement ensures transparency in code provenance and attribution, and further acknowledges the role of AI and the open source community in the development process.
