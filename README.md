## Code Style Policy

To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following style guidelines when contributing:

### 1. Indentation

- Use **2 spaces** per indentation level.
- Do not use tabs.

### 2. Logging

- All non-trivial actions should use the Python `logging` module rather than `print` statements.
- Use appropriate logging levels (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`) based on context.
- Ensure all log messages are clear and actionable.

### 3. Imports

- Standard library imports first, followed by third-party imports, then local application imports.
- Each import group should be separated by a blank line.

### 4. Function and Variable Naming

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and method names.
- Use `CamelCase` for class names.

### 5. Line Length

- Limit all lines to a maximum of **100 characters**.

### 6. Documentation

- All public functions and classes should include docstrings.
- Use [Google-style Python docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

### 7. Type Annotations

- Use Python 3 type annotations for all function arguments and return types where practical.

### 8. Exceptions

- Raise specific exceptions.
- Avoid bare `except:` clauses; catch specific exceptions.

### 9. Miscellaneous

- Remove unused code and commented-out code before submitting.
- Keep code modular and functions short when possible.
